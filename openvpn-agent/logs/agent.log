Welcome to OpenVPN-install!
The git repository is available at: https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install

It looks like OpenVPN is already installed.

What do you want to do?
   1) Add a new user
   2) Revoke existing user
   3) Remove OpenVPN
   4) Exit

Tell me a name for the client.
The name must consist of alphanumeric character. It may also include an underscore or a dash.

Do you want to protect the configuration file with a password?
(e.g. encrypt the private key with a password)
   1) Add a passwordless client
   2) Use a password for the client

* Using SSL: openssl OpenSSL 3.0.2 15 Mar 2022 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.2 15 Mar 2022)

* Using Easy-RSA configuration: /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars

* The preferred location for 'vars' is within the PKI folder.
  To silence this message move your 'vars' file to your PKI
  or declare your 'vars' file with option: --vars=<FILE>
